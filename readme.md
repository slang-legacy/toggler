toggler
=================
CSS3 based toggle buttons

The majority of the files in this repo are just for the development / testing environment (powered by [roots](http://roots.cx)) used while making this. The important parts are `/assets/css/toggler.styl` (the source written in [Stylus](http://learnboost.github.com/stylus/)) and `/public/css/toggler.css` (the compiled css)
